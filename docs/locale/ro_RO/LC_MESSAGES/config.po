msgid "To have multiple accounts running simultaneously, you can appoint an instance ID to a module. Instance ID can be defined by the user, and if defined, it must has nothing other than letters, numbers and underscores, i.e. in regular expressions ``[a-zA-Z0-9_]+``. When instance ID is not defined, the channel will run in the \"default\" instance with no instance ID."

#: ../../config.rst:33
msgid "To indicate the instance ID of an instance, append ``#`` following by the instance ID to the module ID. For example, slave channel ``bar.dummy`` running with instance ID ``alice`` should be defined as ``bar.dummy#alice``. If the channel requires configurations, it should be done in the directory with the same name (e.g. ``EFB_DATA_PATH/profiles/PROFILE/bar.dummy#alice``), so as to isolate instances."
