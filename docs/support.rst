Questions about development and usage
-------------------------------------

If you have any question about developing a module for EFB, or about usages,
you can join our `Gitter chat`_ or `Telegram Group`_ for help.

Or if you have enough reputation on StackOverflow, I am more than appreciated
if you a new tag (``ehforwarderbot``) can be created there when you post a
question [#]_. Let me know so that I can add the tag to my watch list.

.. _Gitter chat: https://gitter.im/blueset/ehForwarderBot
.. _Telegram Group: https://telegram.me/efbsupport
.. [#] StackOverflow requires_ a tag to be on-topic, has at least 2 questions in
    the period of 6 months, and the tag creator to have at least 1,500
    reputations for it to be created.
